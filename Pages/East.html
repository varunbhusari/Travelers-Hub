				<h2> Assam</h2><br><br>
				<img src="../Images/East/873974-53303-oqxbyvptzj-1489158229.jpg" alt="">
				<p>Assam is known for Assam tea and Assam silk. The state was the first site for oil drilling in Asia.
					Assam is home to the one-horned Indian rhinoceros, along with the wild water buffalo, pygmy hog,
					tiger and various species of Asiatic birds, and provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian
					elephant. The Assamese economy is aided by wildlife tourism to Kaziranga National Park and Manas
					National Park, which are World Heritage Sites. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is famed for its feral
					horses. Sal tree forests are found in the state which, as a result of abundant rainfall, look green
					all year round. Assam receives more rainfall than most parts of India; this rain feeds the
					Brahmaputra River, whose tributaries and oxbow lakes provide the region with a hydro-geomorphic
					environment.
					This undisturbed acres long stretch of forests and marshlands is located in the heart of Assam and
					is visited by hordes of tourists every year and it is one of the famous places to visit in North
					East India. The notable one-horned Rhino is a major attraction in Kaziranga which is an endangered
					species in the world.

					Other than that Elephants, wild water buffaloes and Swamp Deers can also be seen on a safari. You
					can either book an Elephant Safari or Jeep safari to explore the park. It is declared UNESCO World
					Heritage Site and is the pride of Assam.</p>

				<h2> Sikkim</h2><br><br>
				<img src="../Images/East/yak-ride.jpg" alt="">
				<p>The Kingdom of Sikkim was founded by the Namgyal dynasty in the 17th century. It was ruled by
					Buddhist priest-kings known as the Chogyal. It became a princely state of British India in 1890.
					Following Indian independence, Sikkim continued its protectorate status with the Union of India
					after 1947, and the Republic of India after 1950. It enjoyed the highest literacy rate and per
					capita income among Himalayan states. In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in front of the
					Chogyal's palace. In 1975, after the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok, a referendum was
					held that led to the deposition of the monarchy and Sikkim joining India as its 22nd state.

					Modern Sikkim is a multiethnic and multilingual Indian state. The official languages of the state
					are English, Nepali, Sikkimese and Lepcha. Additional official languages include Gurung, Limbu,
					Magar, Mukhia, Newari, Rai, Sherpa and Tamang for the purpose of preservation of culture and
					tradition in the state. English is taught in schools and used in government documents. The
					predominant religions are Hinduism and Vajrayana Buddhism. Sikkim's economy is largely dependent on
					agriculture and tourism. As of 2014, the state had the third-smallest GDP among Indian states,
					although it is also among the fastest-growing.

					Sikkim accounts for the largest share of cardamom production in India, and is the world's second
					largest producer of the spice after Guatemala. Sikkim achieved its ambition to convert its
					agriculture to fully organic between 2003 and 2016, and became the first state in India to achieve
					this distinction.It is also among India's most environmentally conscious states, having banned
					plastic water bottles "in any government functions and meetings" and polystyrene products
					(throughout the state).</p>

				<h2> Meghalaya</h2><br><br>
				<img src="../Images/East/shutterstock_1084397681.jpg" alt="">
				<p>Meghalaya was formed by carving out two districts from the state of Assam: the United Khasi Hills and
					Jaintia Hills, and the Garo Hills on 21 January 1972. The population of Meghalaya as of 2016 is
					estimated to be 3,211,474. Meghalaya covers an area of approximately 22,430 square kilometres, with
					a length-to-breadth ratio of about 3:1.

					The state is bound to the south by the Bangladeshi divisions of Mymensingh and Sylhet, to the west
					by the Bangladeshi division of Rangpur, and to the north and east by India's State of Assam. The
					capital of Meghalaya is Shillong. During the British rule of India, the British imperial authorities
					nicknamed it the "Scotland of the East". Meghalaya was previously part of Assam, but on 21 January
					1972, the districts of Khasi, Garo and Jaintia hills became the new state of Meghalaya. English is
					the official language of Meghalaya. Unlike many Indian states, Meghalaya has historically followed a
					matrilineal system where the lineage and inheritance are traced through women; the youngest daughter
					inherits all wealth and she also takes care of her parents.

					The state is the wettest region of India, with the wettest areas in the southern Khasi Hills
					recording an average of 12,000 mm (470 in) of rain a year.About 70 percent of the state is
					forested.The Meghalaya subtropical forests ecoregion encompasses the state; its mountain forests are
					distinct from the lowland tropical forests to the north and south. The forests are notable for their
					biodiversity of mammals, birds, and plants.</p>

				<h2> Mizoram</h2><br><br>
				<img src="../Images/East/a93223f746a112b95965b7bd256e856e.jpg" alt="">
				<p>Mizoram is a state in northeastern India, with Aizawl as its seat of government and capital city. The
					name of the state is derived from "Mizo", the self described name of the native inhabitants, and
					"Ram", which in the Mizo language means "land." Thus "Mizo-ram" means "land of the Mizos". Within
					India's northeast old-Assam region, it is the southernmost landlocked state, sharing borders with
					three of the Seven Sister States of old Assam, namely Tripura, Assam and Manipur. The state also
					shares a 722-kilometre (449 mi) border with the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar.

					Like several other northeastern states of India, Mizoram was previously part of Assam until 1972,
					when it was carved out as a Union Territory. In 1986 the Indian Parliament adopted the 53rd
					amendment of the Indian Constitution, which allowed for the creation of the State of Mizoram on 20
					February 1987, as India's 23rd state.

					According to a 2011 census, in that year Mizoram's population was 1,091,014. It is the 2nd least
					populous state in the country. Mizoram covers an area of approximately 21,087 square kilometres.
					About 91% of the state is forested.

					About 95% of Mizoram's population descends from a diverse tribal origin. Mizos first began to settle
					the area in the 16th century, coming in waves of immigration from Southeast Asia. This immigration
					lasted through the 18th century. Among all of the states of India, Mizoram has the highest
					concentration of tribal people. The Mizoram people are currently protected under the Indian
					constitution as a Scheduled Tribe. Mizoram is one of three states of India with a Christian majority
					(87%). Its people belong to various Christian denominations, being mostly Presbyterians in the north
					and Baptists in the south.</p>

				<h2> Tripura</h2><br><br>
				<img src="../Images/East/tripura.jpg" alt="">
				<p>Tripura is a state in northeastern India. The third-smallest state in the country, it covers 10,491
					km2 (4,051 sq mi) and is bordered by Bangladesh to the north,[9] south, and west, and the Indian
					states of Assam and Mizoram to the east. In 2011 the state had 3,671,032 residents, constituting
					0.3% of the country's population.

					The area of modern Tripura—ruled for several centuries by the Manikya dynasty—was part of an
					independent princely state under the protectorate of the British Empire. The independent Tripuri
					Kingdom (also known as Hill Tippera) joined the newly independent India in 1949.

					Tripura lies in a geographically disadvantageous location in India, as only one major highway, the
					National Highway 8, connects it with the rest of the country. Five mountain ranges—Boromura,
					Atharamura, Longtharai, Shakhan and Jampui Hills—run north to south, with intervening valleys;
					Agartala, the capital, is located on a plain to the west. The state has a tropical savanna climate,
					and receives seasonal heavy rains from the south west monsoon. Forests cover more than half of the
					area, in which bamboo and cane tracts are common. Tripura has the highest number of primate species
					found in any Indian state. Due to its geographical isolation, economic progress in the state is
					hindered. Poverty and unemployment continue to plague Tripura, which has a limited infrastructure.
					Most residents are involved in agriculture and allied activities, although the service sector is the
					largest contributor to the state's gross domestic product.</p>
