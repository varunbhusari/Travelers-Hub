				<h2> Goa</h2><br><br>
				<img src="../Images/West/goa.jpg" alt="">
				<p>Goa is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the region known as the Konkan, and
					geographically separated from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats. It is surrounded by the
					Indian states of Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea
					forming its western coast. It is India's smallest state by area and its fourth-smallest by
					population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states, two and a half times as high
					as the GDP per capita of the country as a whole.The Eleventh Finance Commission of India named Goa
					the best-placed state because of its infrastructure, and India’s National Commission on Population
					rated it as having the best quality of life in India (based on the commission’s “12 Indicators”).

					Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Margão
					in Goa still exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first voyaged to the
					subcontinent in the early 16th century as merchants, and conquered it soon thereafter, whereupon Goa
					became an overseas territory of the Portuguese Empire, part of what was then known as Portuguese
					India, and remained as such for about 450 years, until it was annexed by India in 1961. Goa’s
					official language, which is spoken by a majority of its inhabitants, is Konkani.

					Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year because of its
					white-sand beaches, active nightlife, places of worship, and World Heritage-listed architecture. It
					also has rich flora and fauna because it lies on the Western Ghats range, a biodiversity hotspot.

				<h2> Kutch</h2><br><br>
				<img src="../Images/West/Kutch.png" alt="">
				<p>The history of Kutch can be traced back to prehistoric times. There are several sites related to the
					Indus valley civilization in the region, and it is mentioned in Hindu mythology. In historic times,
					Kutch is mentioned in Greek writings during Alexander. It was ruled by the Buddhist Indian King with
					Greek ancestry from his mother's side Menander I of Greco-Bactrian Kingdom which was overthrown by
					Indo-Scythians followed by Maurya Empire and Sakas. In the first century, it was under Western
					Satraps followed by Gupta Empire. By the fifth century, Maitraka of Valabhi took over from which its
					close association with the ruling clans of Gujarat started. The Chavdas ruled the eastern and
					central parts by the seventh century but came under Chaulukyas by the tenth century. After the fall
					of Chaulukya, the Vaghelas ruled the state. By the thirteenth century, the Vaghelas controlled the
					whole of Kutch and adopted a new dynastic identity, Jadeja.

					For three centuries, Kutch was divided and ruled by three different branches of the Jadeja brothers.
					In the sixteenth century, Kutch was unified under one rule by Rao Khengarji I of these branches, and
					his direct descendants ruled for two centuries and had a good relationship with the Gujarat
					Sultanate and Mughals. One of his descendants, Rayadhan II, left three sons, of whom two died, and a
					third son, Pragmal Ji took over the state and founded the current lineage of rulers at the start of
					the seventeenth century. The descendants of the other brothers founded states in Kathiawar. After
					turbulent periods and battles with the armies of Sindh, the state was stabilized in the middle of
					the eighteenth century by a council known as Bar Bhayat ni Jamat who placed Rao as a titular head
					and ruled independently. The state accepted the sovereignty of the British East India Company in
					1819, when Kutch was defeated in battle. The state was devastated by an earthquake in 1819. The
					state stabilized and flourished in business under subsequent rulers.</p>

				<h2> Diu and Daman</h2><br><br>
				<img src="../Images/West/Diu Daman.jpg" alt="">
				<p>For over 450 years, the coastal enclaves of Daman and Diu on the Arabian Sea coast were part of
					Portuguese India, along with Goa and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Goa, Daman and Diu were incorporated
					into the Republic of India on 19 December 1961, by military conquest. Portugal did not recognise the
					Indian annexation of these territories until the Carnation Revolution of 1974. The territory has
					also been ruled by Kolis.

					The territory of Goa, Daman and Diu was administered as a single union territory until 30 May 1987,
					when Goa was granted statehood, leaving Daman and Diu as a separate union territory. Each enclave
					constituted one of the union territory's two districts. Daman and Diu are approximately 650
					kilometres away from each other by road.

					On 3 November 2019, Daman Collector Rakesh Minhas issued a Section 144 order banning peaceful
					assembly of four or more persons, slogan-shouting and the use of loudspeakers across the entire
					district and ordered the conversion of Government High School, Bhimpore and the Government Sarvottam
					High School, Moti Daman into 'temporary jails'. This was in response to a land ownership dispute
					between the local indigenous fishing community and the local administration that had confiscated
					their land and bulldozed their homes. The ensuing 2019 Daman Indigenous Land Clearing Protests
					resulted with the detention of 70 protesters in the 'temporary jails' and another 8 arrests. Few of
					the adivasi fisherfolk were rehoused whilst most languished traumatised and homeless on the streets
					near the rubble of their razed homes.

					In December 2019, the Parliament of India passed legislation to merge Daman and Diu with the nearby
					union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to create a new union territory to be known as Dadra and
					Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.</p>
